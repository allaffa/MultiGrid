%% FD1D_BVP solves a two point boundary value problem.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    The program uses the finite difference method to solve a BVP
%    (boundary value problem) in one dimension.
%
%    The problem is defined on the region X(1) <= x <= X(N).
%
%    The following differential equation is imposed in the region:
%
%      - d/dx a(x) du/dx + c(x) * u(x) = f(x)
%
%    where a(x), c(x), and f(x) are given functions.  We write out
%    the equation in full as
%
%      - a(x) * u''(x) - a'(x) * u'(x) + c(x) * u(x) = f(x)
%
%    At the boundaries, the following conditions are applied:
%
%      u(X(1)) = 0.0
%      u(X(N)) = 0.0
%
%    A set of N equally spaced nodes is defined on this
%    interval, with X(1) < X(2) < ... < X(N).
%
%    We replace the function U(X) by a vector of values U(1)
%    through U(N), associated with the nodes.
%
%    The values of U(1) and U(N) are determined by the boundary conditions.
%
%    At each interior node I, we write an equation to help us determine
%    U(I).  We do this by approximating the derivatives of U(X) by
%    finite differences.  Let us write XL, XM, and XR for X(I-1), X(I) and X(I+1).
%    Similarly we have UL, UM, and UR.  Other quantities to be evaluated at
%    X(I) = XM will also be labeled with an M:
%
%      - AM * ( UL - 2 UM + UR ) / DX^2 
%      - A'M * ( UL - UR ) / ( 2 * DX ) 
%      + CM * UM = FM
%
%    These N-2 linear equations for the unknown coefficients complete the
%    linear system and allow us to compute the finite difference approximation
%    to the solution of the BVP.
